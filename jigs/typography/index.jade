Nat. des Animaux sans Vertebres\". In these works he up holds the doctrine that all species, including man, are descended from other species. He first did the eminent service of arousing attention to the probability of all change in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the result of law, and not of miraculous interposition."

  h1.ex-title Stout UI Typography
  
  .ex-heading Display Headings
  p.body-01 Display typography is for large and important headings, like 
    | content heading tags or marketing messages. The examples below
    | illustrate these styles on a single line, how they appear when the 
    | text wraps to multiple lines, and when followed immediately by body 
    | text. The typographic style is completely separate from the semantic 
    | markup and meaning.

  .ex-heading Lead Paragraphs
  p.body-01 Paragraphs which start off a section of work, or deserve special 
    | emphasis at the beginning of an article or page, are called <em>lead
    | paragraphs.</em> The lead styles are illustrated below with follow-on
    | body text to exhibit their likely usage.

    | while the second contains <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags (or 
    | <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tags) and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags.

  .ex-heading Captions
  p.body-01 Caption styles can be used for descriptive text near controls or
    | other elements, or as input labels. They're not meant to stand alone, 
    | but instead augment of complement something else by describing it in
    | greater detail. Notice the captions to the left of all styles on this 
    | page, which describe the SASS placeholder selectors.

  .ex
    .ex-label caption-2
    p.caption-2 #{caption}
